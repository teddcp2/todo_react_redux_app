# todo_react_redux_app

This is a non-build version of the todo app which i have on anothor [repository](https://github.com/teddcp2/todo_app).

## Update

1. There is a **non-server app** available which is available on [link](https://vibrant-mclean-0682d7.netlify.app/). It is a complete static site where all the details 
   are managed by **react and redux**.

2. CodeSandbox link - [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/assignmentfareactonly-0hhm3)
